This is an MVP of an attempt to do the following:

1. Provide a single, canonical, up to date place for assessment questions
2. Present them in a nicer way than the Microsoft Excel version does.

Click on the links below to see the prompts for both the previous and current versions of the assessment prompts.

### Versions:

* **CURRENT** - [18-point standard](/service-standard/v2/alpha/) from 1 June 2015 onwards - v.2.00 (last updated 01/06/2015)
* **OLD** - [26-point standard](/service-standard/v1/alpha/) to 1 June 2015 - v.1.20 (last updated 13/11/2014)
